# InstantRhymeWords
A web interface for finding words that rhyme with the last word spoken into the microphone. The interface uses the Chrome [Web Speech API](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2013/01/Voice-Driven-Web-Apps-Introduction-to-the-Web-Speech-API?hl=en) and the [Datamuse API](http://www.datamuse.com/api/) for finding rhyme words as well as matching the last letter of the words for more accurate rhyming.
